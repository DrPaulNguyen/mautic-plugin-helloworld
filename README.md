# Hello World
This is a sample plugin built for Mautic 2 on the [Integrations plugin](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations).

A version for Mautic 3 can be found at [here](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-helloworld/tree/mautic-3).

It does not work in the UI because the API endpoints do not exist. :-) 

However, it can be used as an example in combination with the [Integrations plugin wiki](https://github.com/mautic-inc/plugin-integrations/wiki).
